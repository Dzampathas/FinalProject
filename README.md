# FinalProject

# Analog Synthesia
## Summery
Creating a way to process image sequences or videos into a format that an arduino can understand and output as analogue sound produced by a homemade speaker.

## Component Requirements

- Neodymium magnet
- Copper wire
- Wifi enabled microcontroler
- Wires
- Mosfets
- Resistors

## Challenges
- Making the speakers sound *good*
- Making the code work with videos
- Sending the data live (Or at least displaying the video as it plays)
- Figuring out the micros function

## Timeline

 - **Week 1:** Write Up
 - **Week 2:** Processing Refinement
 - **Week 3:** Arduino Refinement
 - **Week 4:** Expanding the speakers
 - **Week 5:** Final Project
